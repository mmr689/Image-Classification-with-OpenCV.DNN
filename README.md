# Image-Classification-with-OpenCV.DNN

This repository wants to test how to **classify images** using `OpenCV.dnn()`.

The NN models tested are:

**Caffe**:
* AlexNet.
* GoogleNet (Inception V1).
* VGG16/VGG19.

[Here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV) in the OpenCV repository we can find several models that we can use.
